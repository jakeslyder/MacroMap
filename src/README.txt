Description

Macroinvertebrate Water Monitoring Map is based on the ArcGIS Software and uses the Javascript API for this web application.

This code package includes the map and some examples for functionalities tested and adapted for development



Running the Project

Some map functionalities require php and therefore have to run on a webserver (e.g MAMP for Mac or XAMP for Windows)
